### Imaging genomics - The Cancer Genome Atlas - Glioblastoma
In this project, I analyze paired genomic and imaging data from the Glioblastoma cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and The Cancer Imaging Atlas (TCIA) to explore possible associations between imaging and genomic features. 
    
This is situated in the field of radiogenomics which aims at studying possible associations between imaging and genomics with the goal of predicting genomic features using imaging studies. This is extremely desirable given that imaging studies are painless and easily obtained, whereas obtaining genomic features is risky, expensive, and not always possible. 

It has 3 parts, each in different notebooks:
* Imaging Genomics of Glioblastoma I: [Link](https://github.com/ggonzalezp/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/part_1.ipynb)
* Imaging Genomics of Glioblastoma II: [Link](https://github.com/ggonzalezp/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/part_2.ipynb)
* Imaging Genomics of Glioblastoma III: [Link](https://github.com/ggonzalezp/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/part_3.ipynb)
